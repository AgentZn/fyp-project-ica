There is a .zip file that contains these models in h5 format created by Tensorflow Python.

For example, the "pushup-flow" folder holds the files for the pushup-flow model. These are NOT in h5 format as tensorflow js does not support h5. These ".bin" and "model" files are converted from h5 files.

Since there is no need for the original h5 files, these have been zipped up and stored somewhere else. This is a large .zip file of 1.5 GB. There is one copy in the teams project folder and another copy with HCW.
